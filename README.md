Classic Pong arcade game 
This is a Pong game based on the original 1970s Atari video game. It is made to run on any computer running python. It will still retain the old school feel while making some cosmetic changes to make it feel a little more modern, such as color and a little different layout with the paddles and scoreboard.

After trying many codes, I could not one to successfully run on either the school's desktop or my personal home desktop. I believe the issue stems from trying to run pygame, which for some reason does not want to run on either machine. After many searches on the internet, I remedied this issue by using turtle instead, which is a game function on python that already comes with the python program when it is installed. I was then able to make progress from here. I compared existing different codes and tried to make them run using turtle. The original code I tried to use and make work should be visible early in my commits. I ended up deleting it from my repository to avoid confusion as to which was the correct and final program.
I am still learning Python so I will make mistaks.
